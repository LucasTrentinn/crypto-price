## Crypto Prices - Technical Test

- This is a front-end SPA developed to consume the [API CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) using Vue.js.

- If you want to see the SPA running, simply enter the link: https://crypto-prices-test.herokuapp.com/

Feel free to use the application and send me any message about it :)

### Using it in your local machine

If you want to use this code on your own computer, simply follow the steps:

  1. Clone this repository in your local machine;
  2. Run *npm install* in the folder terminal;
  3. Then, simply use *npm run dev* on the terminal and the app will start using a *http://localhost:3000/* local path.

  Obs.: This guide presumes you have some familiarity with Vue, so I'll not take time explaining every line of code in order to install and run it locally.

After those steps, the application will be running locally in your pc. Enjoy :)

### About the project

This Single Page Application (SPA) was designed in order to be as simple as a SPA can be. 

You'll find it to have only one route. There you can informations about a crypto like it's name, ticker, logo and price. On the right side of the page you may use the *Historical Price* section to insert a date and time, and the app will return to you the price of the current crypto in this date and time.

Also, at the *Choose your crypto* section is a list of the cryptos you may see informations, simply click any of them and the informations will be automatically updated. When changing to another crypto the *Historical Price* section will be automatically updated too.

The proposition of this design is to be simple, clean and direct. The colors, fonts and disposition were designed so anyone can easily understand what to do and how to do it. 

As this is a responsive layout you may use it both on PC and Phone:
